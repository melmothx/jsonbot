Welcome to JSONBOT
=======================

FeedProvider is a wave and xmpp bot for pushing pubsubhubbub feeds to Google
Wave and Jabber. Combined with a feed fetching service like superfeedr.com it can
deliver your feeds on multiple platforms (wave and xmpp are suported now though xmpp conferences are not yet supported), IRC support is being
provided by a seperate standalone program (under development right now).

FeedProvider is free code (MIT) and can be cloned where needed. Source code
is at http://jsonbot.googlecode.com. Live demo at http://jsonbot.appspot.com (web) and jsonbot@appspot.com
(wave/xmpp).

To register a feed use !hb-register <feedname> <url> or !hb-start <feedname>
if the feed is already added.

this bot needs google_appengine installed in your home dir

jsonbot provides the following programs:

* fpr - console version of jsonbot
* fpr-irc - IRC version of jsonbot
* fpr-release - create a new release directory
* fpr-run - run a release in the GAE dev_appserver
