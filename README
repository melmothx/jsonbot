FeedProvider is a wave and xmpp bot for pushing pubsubhubbub feeds to Google Wave and
Jabber. Combined with a feed fetching service like superfeedr.com it can
deliver your feeds on multiple platforms (wave and xmpp are suported now
though xmpp conferences are not yet supported), IRC support is being
provided by a seperate standalone program (under development right now).

FeedProvider is free code (MIT) and can be cloned where needed. Source code
is at http://jsonbot.googlecode.com. Live demo at http://jsonbot.org
(web) and jsonbot@appspot.com (wave/xmpp).

To register a feed use !hb-register <feedname> <url> or !hb-start <feedname>
if the feed is already added.

see docs/INSTALL on how to upload your own bot.
