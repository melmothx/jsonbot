whats it for
------------

most of the links here are directories.

::

    * bin - contains all the programs provided by JSONBOT.
    * commonplugs - all the plugins that work on both GAE and shell.
    * docs - has all the documentation .. run ./bib/jsb-dodocs to populate this
             dir. (needs sphinx installed)
    * gaeupload - template directory of every file uploaded to the GAE
    * gozerdata - contain all the bots data and config files. copy this dir into
                  new bots with the ./bin/jsb-import command.
    * gozerlib - is the main library of the bot .. has all the classes and
                 modules etc.
    * LICENSE - license file
    * MANIFEST.in - file used to determine what needs to be installed by setup.py
    * README - the bots README file
    * releases - directory where the uploads (releases) for the GAE are stored.
                 releases get cloned from the gaeupload dir. 
    * setup.py - the setup script for JSONBOT. use python setup.py install to
                 install the bot global (or use easy_install jsonbot).
    * simplejson - json library used by JSONBOT
    * socketplugs - plugins that only work on socket based bots (shell).
    * tests - some unittests for JSONBOT. use jsb-test to run them (uses nose).
    * waveplugs - plugins that only work on the wave platform
