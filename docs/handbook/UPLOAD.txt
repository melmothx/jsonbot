UPLOAD
======

JSONBOT uses a directory in your home in that contains all the site specific
files such as app.yaml, credentials.py and mainconfig. These files are
expected in the ~/jsonregs/<botname> directory. When runnng
./bin/jsb-release for the first time these files will be created and can then be
edited. JSONBOT needs the google_appengine package installed in your home dir as well.

you need an account on the Google Application Engine. see http://appengine.google.com/

1) run jsb-release <yourbotname> - this will create a uploadable dir 
2) run jsb-upload <yourbotname>

this enables web and xmpp, for wave you need to do the following:

3) go to https://wave.google.com/wave/robot/register and register your bot
4) edit ~/regs/<yourbotname>/ dir and copy the verification token and secret to the credentials.py file
5) run jsb-release <yourbotname>
6) run jsb-upload <yourbotname>
7) once its uploaded click the "verify" button
8) copy the consumer key and secret to the credentials.py file en run jsb-upload again
9) done !

now you should be able to do the following:

1) visit the website at http://<yourbotname>.appspot.com
2) add the bot as Jabber buddy at <yourbotname>@appspot.com
3) the same as wave bot
