UPLOAD
======

JSONBOT uses a directory in your home in that contains all the site specific
files such as app.yaml, credentials.py and mainconfig. These files are
expected in the ~/jsbregs/<botname> directory. When runnng
./bin/jsb-release for the first time these files will be created and can then be
edited. JSONBOT needs the google_appengine package installed in your home dir as well.

you need an account on the Google Application Engine. see http://appengine.google.com/

you also need to enable openid authentication (federated login) on your app, it's in
Applcation Settings in your admin console.

1) run jsb-uploadall <yourbotname> - this will create a uploadable dir and upload it to the
   GAE, enabling web and xmpp. For wave you need to do the following:

2) go to https://wave.google.com/wave/robot/register and register your bot
3) edit ~/regs/<yourbotname>/ dir and copy the verification token and secret to the credentials.py file
4) run jsb-uploadall <yourbotname>
5) once its uploaded click the "verify" button
6) copy the consumer key and secret to the credentials.py file en run jsb-upload again
7) done !

now you should be able to do the following:

1) visit the website at http://<yourbotname>.appspot.com
2) add the bot as Jabber buddy at <yourbotname>@appspot.com
3) the same as wave bot
