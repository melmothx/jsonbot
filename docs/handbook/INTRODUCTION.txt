INTRODUCTION
============

Welcome to JSONBOT, i will explain here what you can do with the bot and how
to get started with it.

What is JSONBOT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

JSONBOT is all of the following:

    * a shell console bot
    * a shell IRC bot
    * a shell XMPP bot
    * a Web bot running on Google Application Engine
    * a XMPP bot running on Google Application Engine
    * a Google Wave bot running op Google Application Engine
    * the XMPP bots are used to communicate between bots
    * plugin infrastructure to write your own functionality
    * event driven framework by the use of callbacks

Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

note: the bot needs to have a control character to execute commands. default
is ! .. so use !help for example.

Install the bot from mercurial repository or untar the tarball 

::

    hg clone http://jsonbot.appspot.com/hg jsonbot
    

All the programs have a --help option that shows a help page describing all
the command line options of the program.

Shell console bot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the bot dir run the ./bin/jsb command to start the console version of the bot.

    ::

        09:15:01 bart@done:~/jsonbot/0.2.1/first/plugs$ ./bin/jsb
        JSONBOT 0.2.1 RELEASE SOCKET CONSOLE
        > 

Shell IRC bot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

run the following to make the bot connect to an IRC server:

    ::

        ./bin/jsb-irc -o <owner> -s <server> -c \<channel>

Take note you need to escape the # character of the channel name.
a configuration file will be generated from the command line opions so the
next time you want to start the bot you can just use:

    ::

        ./bin/jsb-irc

Shell XMPP bot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

run the following to make the bot connect to an Jabber server:

    ::

        ./bin/jsb-xmpp -o <owner> -u <bot JID> -p <password> [-c <conference>] [-s <server>]

Conference and server options are optional. Server is take from the -u
option if not provided as a seperate option. 

GAE bots
~~~~~~~~

To use the Google Application Engine bots the bot needs to be uploaded into
the GAE cloud. See the UPLOAD docs on how to upload the bot into the GAE
cloud.

Plugins
~~~~~~~

to see what plugins are available use the !list command. Use !help <plugin>
to get help on a plugin. If a plugin is not responding try !reload <plugin>
otherwise try !admin-boot that will regenerate the callbacks and command
indexes.
