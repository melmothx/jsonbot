INTRODUCTION
============

Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get the latest tarball from:

    ::

        http://code.google.com/p/jsonbot/downloads/list

Or install from mercurial:

    ::

        hg clone http://jsonbot.googlecode.com/hg jsb
    

You can also grab the latest from github:

    ::

        git clone git://github.com/jsonbot/jsonbot.git
        
Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data and configuratiion files can be found in the datadir which defaults to ~/.jsb (or
another directory if the -d option is used).  You can either use commandline
options to generate the configuration files or run:

    ::

        ./bin/jsb-init

to have them created for you. Look for the config/fleet directory for bot configuration files.


Shell console bot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the bot dir run the ./bin/jsb command to start the console version of the bot.

    ::

        22:44:11 dev@done:~/dev/0.7/5$ ./bin/jsb
        JSONBOT 0.7 ALPHA1 CONSOLE
        >

If you just want to execute 1 command on the bot, you can do that by giving
it as an argument:

    ::

        22:45:24 dev@done:~/dev/0.7/5$ ./bin/jsb list
        available plugins: 8b, admin, alias, ask, chan, chatlog, choice,
        controlchar, core, count, data, echo, fleet, foo, forward, gatekeeper,
        gcalc, grep, hubbub, idle, ipcalc, irc, karma, kickban, koffie, learn, misc,
        more, mpd, nickserv, not, outputcache, plug, ps, quote, relay, reload,
        remind, restserver, reverse, rss, seen, shop, sort, tail, test, tinyurl, to,
        todo, twitter, udp, uniq, url, urlinfo, user, userstate, watcher, weather,
        welcome, wikipedia, xmpp
 

Shell IRC bot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the following to make the bot connect to an IRC server:

    ::

        ./bin/jsb-irc -o <userhost of owner> -s <server> -c \<channel>

A configuration file will be generated from the command line opions. If you
already have the configuration files (generated by jsb-init) you can just use (without any options):

    ::

        ./bin/jsb-irc


Shell XMPP bot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the following to make the bot connect to an Jabber server:

    ::

        ./bin/jsb-xmpp -o <owner JID> -u <bot JID> -p <password> [-c <conference>] [-s <server>]

Or when configuration files already exist, just run the bot without arguments:

    ::

        ./bin/jsb-xmpp

Conference and server options are optional. Server is take from the -u
option if not provided as a seperate option. 

GAE bots
~~~~~~~~

To use the Google Application Engine bots the bot needs to be uploaded into
the GAE cloud. See the UPLOAD doc in the handbook on how to upload the bot into the GAE
cloud.

Plugins
~~~~~~~

To see what plugins are available use the !list command. Use !help <plugin>
to get help on a plugin. 

    ::

        23:03:00 dev@done:~/dev/0.7/5$ ./bin/jsb help misc
        HELP ON MISC misc commands.,     !source - <i> show where to fetch the bot
        source. </i> - examples: source,     !test - <i> give test response. </i> -
        examples:  test



If a plugin is not responding try !plug-enable <plugin>:

    :: 

        23:03:05 dev@done:~/dev/0.7/5$ ./bin/jsb
        JSONBOT 0.7 ALPHA1 CONSOLE
        > !plug-enable misc
        reloading and enabling jsb.plugs.core.misc
        done - plug-enable misc
        > 


otherwise try !admin-boot:

    ::

        23:05:46 dev@done:~/dev/0.7/5$ ./bin/jsb
        JSONBOT 0.7 ALPHA1 CONSOLE
        > !admin-boot
        done - admin-boot
        > 


this will regenerate the callbacks and command indexes. 

You can also use !apro <search> to search for commands:

    ::

        23:01:23 dev@done:~/dev/0.7/5$ ./bin/jsb apro wiki
        commands matching wiki: wikipedia


Commandline Help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the programs have a --help option that shows a help page describing the command line options of the program.
