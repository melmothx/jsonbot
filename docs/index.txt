Welcome to JSONBOT
==================

JSONBOT is a bot that stores all its data in json format. It runs on the 
Google Application Engine and can thus support wave, web and XMPP.
Standalone programms are provided for IRC, XMPP and console, the goal is to 
let both clientside and GAE side communicate through JSON either over XMPP or 
HTTP POST.
